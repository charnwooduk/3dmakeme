# This file keeps the uploads directory in Git while ignoring all contents
#
# The uploads/ directory is where WordPress stores media files (images, videos, etc.)
#
# We keep this directory structure in Git but exclude all actual files via .gitignore
# This ensures the directory exists when you clone the repo, but media files
# are not tracked (they can be very large and change frequently)
#
# To backup/restore media files, use:
# - rsync
# - Cloud storage (S3, etc.)
# - Separate backup scripts
